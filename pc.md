## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?

 Free and open source software for distributed version control: tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.

3. Why do we create a branch?

Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?

Lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.

git checkout

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?

git fetch is a primary command used to download contents from a remote repository.

Git's way of putting a forked history back together again.

git pull updates your current HEAD branch with the latest changes from the remote server. This means that pull not only downloads new data; it also directly integrates it into your current working copy files.

7. What is a merge conflict?

Merge conflicts occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
   
The most direct way to resolve a merge conflict is to edit the conflicted file.
